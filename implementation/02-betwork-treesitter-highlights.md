### Plan for Tree-sitter Highlighting

- [x] Create the `tree-sitter-betwork/queries/highlights.scm` file.
- [x] Define queries in `highlights.scm` to capture keywords, strings, numbers, comments, and other syntax elements.
- [x] Create the `tree-sitter-betwork/test/highlight/work.txt` file for testing the highlighting rules.
- [x] Add code snippets to `work.txt` that cover all defined highlighting rules.
- [x] Add assertions in `work.txt` to verify the correct highlighting for each code snippet.
- [x] Run the tests using the `tree-sitter highlight` command.
