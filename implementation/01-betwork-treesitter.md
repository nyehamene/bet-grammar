### Plan for Tree-sitter Parser Implementation

- [ ] Create the `tree-sitter-betwork/` directory to house the parser project.
- [ ] Create the Tree-sitter grammar file (`grammar.js`) using `tree-sitter init-grammar`. This will also initialize the Node.js project.
- [ ] Convert the `work.grammar` file into a Tree-sitter `grammar.js` file.
- [ ] Generate the C parser from the `grammar.js` file.
- [ ] Write example `work` files to test the parser.
- [ ] Run the Tree-sitter CLI to parse the test files and validate the results.
- [ ] Organize the final parser files within the `tree-sitter-betwork/` directory.
